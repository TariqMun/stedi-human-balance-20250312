This project is a part of Stedi Human Balance Analytics intiaitve, where we build a data lakehouse solution to process sensot data from the STEDI Step Trainer and its mobile app. The goal is to curaet data for training a machine learning model to detect steps and improve balance excercises.  
As a data engineer on the STEDI Step Trainer team, I need to extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, and curate them into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model.
The key focus areas are:
1.Extract data frin the STEDI Step trainer sensors and the mobile app
2. Leverage the motion sensor data to train a machine learning model to detect steps accurately in real-time
3. Ensure Privacy reamins a primary consideration in deciding what data can be used
4. Only curated/shortlised customersâ€™ Step Trainer and accelerometer data should be used in the training data for the machine learning model.
